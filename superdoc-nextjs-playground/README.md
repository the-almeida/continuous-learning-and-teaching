## Nextjs + SuperDoc Playground

This application is a playground to try out [SuperDoc](https://www.superdoc.dev) with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org). The project was created under my continuous-learning-and-teaching repo which contain some experimental code that I'm actively writing. The first goal here is to display my CV and experiment with SuperDoc configs.

#### Here is the live demo link: https://superdoc.thealmeida.online/

## Running it locally

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) with your browser and you should see my CV.
